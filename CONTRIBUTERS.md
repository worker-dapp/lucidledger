## How This Works
- Contributions are recognized automatically in Git history (commits, issues, PRs).  
- We also maintain this page so that contributions beyond code are acknowledged.  
- Emojis indicate the type of contribution:  
  - 💻 code  
  - 📖 documentation  
  - 🐛 bug reports  
  - 🎨 design  
  - 💡 ideas  
  - 🤔 user testing  
  - 📢 outreach  
  - (and more — see the [all-contributors emoji key](https://allcontributors.org/docs/en/emoji-key))

## Alumni
When contributors move on from active development, they remain listed here in recognition of their work. Contributions are never erased.

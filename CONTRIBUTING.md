# Contributing

## Welcome!

Thank you for your interest in contributing to this project. We are a collaborative, academic open-source effort. To keep things sustainable, we follow a simple contributor lifecycle and permissions policy.

## How to Contribute

- **Issues**: Use the issue tracker for bug reports, feature requests, or questions.  
- **Pull Requests**: Fork the repository, create a branch, and open a pull request. Please link issues if relevant.  
- **Code of Conduct**: We expect all interactions to follow respectful and inclusive practices.

## Contributor Lifecycle Policy

We are an academic project with many contributors who rotate in and out (e.g., students, research assistants). To balance collaboration and governance, we follow this lifecycle:

1. **External Contributor**  
   - Anyone may submit pull requests.  
   - Contributions are attributed via Git history automatically.  

2. **Member**  
   - Active students/researchers may be invited to join the organization as *Members*.  
   - Members typically receive **Write** or **Maintain** access to specific repositories.  

3. **Owner**  
   - Reserved for long-term faculty and designated project maintainers.  
   - Owners manage organization settings, billing, and membership.  
   - The number of owners is intentionally small for security and sustainability.  

4. **Alumni**  
   - When a student/researcher completes their role, they are removed from organization membership.  
   - Their contributions remain permanently visible in Git history and the Contributors graph.  
   - They may also be listed in `CONTRIBUTORS.md` or via the [all-contributors bot](https://allcontributors.org/) to recognize their efforts.

## Recognition of Contributions

We use the [all-contributors specification](https://allcontributors.org/) to recognize all types of contributions (üíª code, üìñ docs, üêõ bug reports, üé® design, etc.). This ensures that every form of work, technical or otherwise, is acknowledged.

## Questions

If you are unsure about your role, permissions, or the lifecycle policy, please reach out to a current **Owner** before making assumptions about access.

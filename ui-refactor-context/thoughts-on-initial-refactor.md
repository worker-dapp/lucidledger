## Employee Side

Essentially there are two employee-centered landing pages now--the one for the site as a whole and the one for the employee dashboard. There is a bit of redundancy here that needs to be eliminated.

When you click on a link to go to another page on the site, it makes you log in to the employee side before accessing that page. Is this necessarily how we want it to work? 

Look to Monster.com to see how they handle this. Do you have to log in to view job listings? At what point do they require you to log in?
